Many creators in this group are experimenting with AI. Some feel excited. Some feel overwhelmed. Some are worried about falling behind.

Here’s what YouTube’s CEO Neal Mohan just added to that conversation:
""The rise of AI has raised concerns about low-quality content, aka ‘AI slop.’ With this openness comes a responsibility to maintain the high quality viewing experience that people want. To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.""
This tells us something important about strategy:
YouTube isn’t only looking at how often you upload
It’s looking at whether your videos create a quality viewing experience for real people
What this looks like in my own workflow:
In my own case, AI only started helping when I stopped treating it like a magic button and started folding it into a system. I used AI and simple video templates to take some of the friction out of scripting, planning, and repurposing, especially on days when my energy wasn’t predictable. What actually moved the needle, though, wasn’t “more output” - it was my judgment about what to keep, what to cut, and how to make each piece feel like me instead of a generic AI script.
From a channel growth point of view, here’s how I’d suggest we think about AI:
🔹 Use AI to reduce friction (ideas, outlines, repurposing)
🔹 Keep the human layer for stories, opinions, and specific examples
🔹 Aim for videos that someone could watch and say, ""That felt real and it helped me""

You don’t need to out‑publish everyone. You need a sustainable workflow that produces content you’re proud to put your name on.
🎯 Comment with one way you’re currently using AI (or considering it) that you believe actually makes your content better, not just faster.
If you share, I’ll circle back with thoughts on how to keep those uses firmly on the ""anti‑slop"" side.","Nothing yet for CTA","Gonna make an image before going live.","https://base44.app/api/apps/696d0019e74d99e5ec9b9e1e/files/public/696d0019e74d99e5ec9b9e1e/7c76d4c5c_recording-1769369757882.webm","4.2","draft","","0","false","false","false","[]","","","","video","","","","","","","public","false","","none","","","","","text_only","","","","","","","single_post","","","[""""]","","video","","","post","feed_post","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","697670a951c0372b515608e7","2026-01-25T19:36:09.913000","2026-01-25T19:36:09.913000","696d0019e74d99e5ec9b9e1f","gord.isman@gmail.com","false"
