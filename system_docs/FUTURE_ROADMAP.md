# 🚀 Future Roadmap & Feature Blacklog

This document tracks planned features and enhancements for future phases of Content Alchemy Command.

## Phase 2: External Integration & Automation

### 1. Hashtag Manager (Tag Groups)
*   **Concept:** Create and save groups of hashtags (e.g., "Marketing Mix", "Tech Trends") to be inserted into posts with a single click.
*   **Why Needed:** Critical for Phase 2 API integration, as different platforms have different tag limits and format requirements.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Create/Edit/Delete Tag Groups.
    *   "Shuffle" tags within a group (to avoid spam penalties).
    *   Platform-specific limits (e.g., max 30 for Insta, max 3 for LinkedIn).
    *   Auto-append to post body or first comment.

### 2. Direct API Integration (The "Push")
*   **Concept:** Automatically publish scheduled posts to social platforms (LinkedIn, X, etc.) without manual intervention.
*   **Why Needed:** True "Set and Forget" automation.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   OAuth connection for each platform.
    *   Status updates (Success/Fail webhooks).
    *   Media upload handling.

### 3. Analytics Dashboard V2
*   **Concept:** Pull *real* engagement data (Likes, Shares, Comments) back into the system.
*   **Why Needed:** To close the feedback loop and inform future content strategy.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Post-performance metrics.
    *   "Best Time to Post" suggestions.
    *   Idea-to-Viral conversion tracking.
