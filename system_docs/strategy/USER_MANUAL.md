# 🎮 Content Alchemy Command: User Manual

Welcome to your **Content Alchemy Command Center**. This is your dedicated operating system for content strategy, production, and analysis.

---

## 🧭 The Core Modules

Your Command Center is divided into three primary workspaces, designed to match the three phases of content creation:

1.  **The Idea Vault** (Strategy & Collection)
2.  **The Studio** (Production & Assembly)
3.  **The Horizon** (Scheduling & Traffic Control)

You also have:
*   **System Health:** A dashboard to track your performance against your strategy.
*   **Settings:** Where you configure your Content Pillars and Platform Goals.

---

## 1. The Idea Vault 💡
*Where ideas are born, stored, and incubated.*

**Goal:** Capture every fleeting thought so you never run out of content.

### Key Features
*   **"Select Mode"**: Click this to bulk-edit multiple ideas (e.g., move 5 ideas from "Incubating" to "Ready" at once).
*   **Status Workflow**:
    *   🟡 **Incubating**: Raw ideas, half-baked thoughts.
    *   🟢 **Ready**: Fully formed concepts ready to become posts. (These appear in the Studio).
    *   ⚪ **Completed**: Ideas that have been used and are done.
*   **Filters**: Use the top bar to filter by Status, Favorites, or Search keywords.

---

## 2. The Studio 🎨
*Where ideas become posts.*

**Goal:** Turn your "Ready" ideas into platform-specific content (LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.).

### The Layout
*   **Left Column ("Ideas Ready"):** This is your menu of available concepts. These are pulled directly from the Vault (Green status).
*   **Center Lanes (The Assembly Line):** Each column represents a platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube...).

### The Workflow
1.  **Spawn a Post:**
    *   **From an Idea:** Find a "Ready" Idea in the left column and click **"Spawn Post"**. This links the post to the strategy.
    *   **From Scratch:** Click the **"New Starter Post"** button in the left sidebar to create a post without an idea.
2.  **Select Platform:** Choose where this piece of content will live (e.g., LinkedIn).
3.  **Edit Content:** The **Post Editor** opens.
    *   **Content Tab:** Write your main body text here.
    *   **Platform Specific Tab:** Fill in platform details (e.g., "Scroll Stopper" for LinkedIn, "Tags" for YouTube).
    *   **Idea Resources:** Access links/files from the original idea without leaving the screen.
4.  **Save as Draft:** It now appears in the appropriate Platform Lane.

### Post Lifecycle (Status)
Every post moves through four stages:
1.  ⬜ **Draft:** You are still working on it. It lives in the Studio lane but isn't on the calendar yet.
2.  🟨 **Scheduled:** You have assigned a date/time. It now appears on the **Horizon** calendar.
3.  🟩 **Published:** It is live! Mark it as published to close the loop.
4.  📦 **Archived:** Old content you want to hide from the main view but keep for data history. (Toggle "Show Archived" in Studio filters to see these).

### Quick Actions
*   **Drag & Drop:** Reorder posts within a lane to prioritize them.
*   **Move Lane:** Use the "Arrow" icon on a card to move a post from one platform to another (e.g., turn a LinkedIn post into an Email).
*   **View Manifesto:** Click the **Sparkle Icon (✨)** on any post to see the original strategic idea card it came from.

### Advanced Filters
Use the top bar to drill down into your content:
*   **Search:** Find posts by Title, Body text, or ID (e.g. #POST-102).
*   **Pillar:** Show only posts belonging to a specific topic.
*   **Horizon:** Filter by date (e.g., "Last 7 Days + Future").
*   **Status:** Toggle between everything, or just "Published" / "Drafts".

---

## 3. The Horizon 📅
*Where posts are scheduled and dispatched.*

**Goal:** Visualize your publishing cadence and ensure you are hitting your deadlines.

### The Layout
*   **Left ("Loading Dock"):** Posts that are written but don't have a date yet.
*   **Center (Calendar):** Your monthly view.

### The Visual Code
Every dot on the calendar tells a story:
*   **Dot Color:** Represents the **Platform** (e.g., Pink = Instagram, Blue = LinkedIn).
*   **Ring Color:** Represents the **Content Pillar** (Strategy). *Are you balancing your topics correctly?*

### How to Schedule
*   **Drag & Drop:** Simply drag a post from the "Loading Dock" onto a calendar date.
*   **Reschedule:** Drag a post from one day to another.

### The Loading Dock Modes
The Left Sidebar has two modes:
1.  **Backlog (Default):** Shows new drafts waiting for a date.
2.  **Resurface (Evergreen):** Shows your best performing *old* posts that are ready to be reposted (based on your "Repurpose Cycle" settings).
    *   *Green List:* Ready to go.
    *   *Red List:* Not ready yet.

## 4. System Health 📊
*Are you sticking to the plan?*

This dashboard helps you answer five critical questions:

1.  **"Am I talking about the right things?"** (Pillar Alignment Tracker)
    *   Compares your *Actual* output vs. your *Strategic Target*.
    *   *Goal:* Keep the colored bars (actuals) close to the grey bars (targets).

2.  **"Am I posting consistently?"** (Omnichannel Velocity Map)
    *   A visual timeline (scatter plot) of every post you've shipped.
    *   *Goal:* Look for consistent patterns and identify large gaps in your schedule.

3.  **"Have I neglected any topics?"** (Dynamic Production Audit)
    *   Checks the "freshness" of each Content Pillar.
    *   **Green (Fresh):** You posted about this recently (<14 days).
    *   **Yellow (Stale):** It's been a while (14-30 days).
    *   **Red (Neglected):** You haven't touched this topic in over a month (>30 days).

4.  **"Are my ideas gathering dust?"** (Incubation Audit)
    *   Identifies "Stagnant Ideas" that have been sitting in the Vault for too long (>30/60/90 days) without being developed.
    *   *Action:* Use this list to either kill old ideas or finally move them to "Ready."

5.  **"Did I miss a deadline?"** (Schedule Audit)
    *   Flag posts that were scheduled for the past but are not marked as "Published."
    *   *Action:* Reschedule them or mark them as done.

## 5. Settings ⚙️
*Configure your strategy.*

*   **Content Pillars:** Define your core topics and assign them colors.
*   **Strategy Allocation:** Set your target % for each pillar (e.g., "I want 50% of my posts to be about 'Strategy'.").
*   **Lane Visibility:** Turn platforms ON or OFF depending on what you are focusing on right now.
*   **User Management:** (Admin Only) Invite new team members or revoke access.
*   **Danger Zone:**
    *   **Backup & Recovery:** Download a portable `.json` snapshot of your entire database (Export) or restore your system from a previous backup (Import). *Use this for migrating data between computers or creating safety checkpoints.*
    *   **System Reset:** Wipe everything and restore "Golden Data" defaults.
    *   **Wipe Content Only:** Delete all posts and ideas but keep your settings and pillars intact.
