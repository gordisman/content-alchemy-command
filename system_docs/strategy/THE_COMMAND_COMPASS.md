# 🧭 The Command Compass: Fleet Operations Guide

Use this guide to "Switch Gears" between development, testing yourself, and updating clients.

---

## 🛠️ World 1: The Sandbox (Localhost)
**Goal:** Build new features without breaking anything live. Use a "Fake" local database.
1.  **Switch Hat:** `npm run env:dev`
2.  **Start Engine:** `npm run dev:all`
3.  **Result:** Work at `http://localhost:5173`. Total safety.

---

## 🚀 World 2: The Pilot's Chair (Gord Prod)
**Goal:** verify your changes are "Battle-Ready" on your own real production site.
1.  **Switch Hat:** `npm run env:gord`
2.  **Build:** `npm run build`
3.  **Deploy:** `firebase deploy --only hosting` (or `firebase deploy` for everything)
4.  **Result:** Your site at `cac-prod-gord.web.app` is updated. Test it thoroughly here!

## 🏗️ World 3: The Fleet Admiral (Laurie / Clients)
**Goal:** Promote your verified features to your paying clients.
1.  **Switch Hat:** `npm run env:laurie`
2.  **Build:** `npm run build` (This bundles the code specifically for her "house")
3.  **Deploy:** `firebase deploy`
4.  **Result:** Laurie's site is updated. **Success!**

## 🔍 How to tell "Where am I?" 
If you get lost, look at your Terminal:
1.  **The Compass Prompt:** Run `firebase target` or look at the output of your last `env` command.
2.  **The File Check:** Look at the hidden file `.env.local` in your root folder. 
    *   If it doesn't exist? You are in **Sandbox (Dev)**.
    *   If it exists? The first line tells you if it's **Gord** or **Laurie**.

### 💡 Professional Protocol (The Golden Path)
1. Always start in **World 1 (Sandbox)**.
2. Once happy, push to **World 2 (Gord)** and test on your phone/live.
3. Once verified, push to **World 3 (Laurie)**.
